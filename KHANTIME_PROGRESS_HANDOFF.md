- ‚ùå LessonViewModel for content display
- ‚ùå ProgressViewModel for tracking
- ‚ùå SettingsViewModel for configuration

### üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

1. **QTI 404 Error**: Hardcoded QTI URL returns 404
   - Need to fetch valid test URLs from QTI API
   - URL: `https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/api/assessment-tests/test-67aa14ec-3-PP.1`

2. **Duplicate Content**: Creating test content multiple times adds duplicates
   - Need to check if content exists before creating

3. **API Data Issues**:
   - Invalid grade formats in some courses
   - GraphQL endpoint doesn't exist (REST-only)

4. **Limited Course Loading**: Currently fetching only 100 courses due to data issues

### üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (UPDATED)

**üöÄ QUICK WINS (Can be done rapidly):**

1. **‚úÖ ~~Implement Theme System~~** - COMPLETED!
2. **AppContainer for Dependency Injection** ‚ö° NEXT PRIORITY
   ```swift
   // Create AppContainer.swift with:
   // - Provider management (ContentProvider, ThemeProvider)
   // - Service initialization (APIService, CourseService)
   // - Clean dependency injection throughout app
   ```

3. **Apply Themes to Remaining Views** ‚ö° QUICK WIN
   ```swift
   // Update SyllabusView, QTIView, LoginView to use theme system
   // Already have theme infrastructure, just need to apply it
   ```

4. **Create Missing ViewModels** ‚ö° QUICK WIN
   ```swift
   // LessonViewModel, ProgressViewModel, SettingsViewModel
   // Follow existing patterns from DashboardViewModel/LoginViewModel
   ```

**üéØ MEDIUM EFFORT:**

5. **MockProvider for Testing**
   ```swift
   // Implement MockProvider conforming to ContentProvider
   // Useful for development and testing UI without API calls
   ```

6. **AlphaProgressManager (2-hour learning)**
   ```swift
   // Implement progress tracking for 2-hour methodology
   // Session timing, efficiency metrics, progress persistence
   ```

**üîç INVESTIGATION NEEDED:**

7. **Find Valid QTI URLs**
   ```swift
   // Check https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar for working assessment URLs
   // Current hardcoded URL returns 404
   ```

### üîó KEY RESOURCES

- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/tennyson-mccalla/KhanTime
- **Alpha 1EdTech API**: https://api.staging.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar
- **QTI API**: https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar
- **Architecture Doc**: KHANTIME_MVP_ARCHITECTURE.md

### üí° ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS

1. **Protocol-First Approach Works**: Easy to swap implementations
2. **API Has Data Quality Issues**: Need robust error handling
3. **Modular Design Validated**: Could swap providers without breaking UI
4. **TimeBack Integration Complex**: Multiple APIs (OneRoster, PowerPath, QTI)

### üéØ MVP COMPLETION ESTIMATE

Based on the architecture phases:
- **Phase 1**: 80% complete (protocols done, providers partial, need AppContainer)
- **Phase 2**: 40% complete (TimeBack works, hero landing complete, no GitHub/Mock)
- **Phase 3**: 65% complete (complete theme system + stunning hero landing)
- **Phase 4**: 5% complete (animations exist in hero landing)

**Overall**: ~47% of MVP complete (+12% from hero landing implementation!)

### üìù FOR THE NEXT DEVELOPER

1. ‚úÖ ~~Start with the theme system - it's the most visible improvement~~ DONE!
2. ‚úÖ ~~Create stunning landing page~~ DONE! (HeroLandingView is beautiful!)
3. The protocols are solid - implement against them
4. TimeBack API works but has quirks - see CourseService.swift
5. QTI integration needs real test URLs from their API

**üéØ CURRENT TOP PRIORITIES:**
- **AppContainer for dependency injection** (foundational improvement)
- **Apply themes to SyllabusView, QTIView** (quick visual wins)
- **AlphaProgressManager for 2-hour learning** (core feature)
- **Missing ViewModels** (LessonViewModel, ProgressViewModel, SettingsViewModel)
- **MockProvider** (development efficiency)
