To do this, simply multiply the numerators and denominators separately. For example, when raising a fraction like 2/3 to the third power, multiply the numerators (2 × 2 × 2 = 8) and the denominators (3 × 3 × 3 = 27) to get the result 8/27. This method applies to all powers, making it easy to understand and apply.","translatedTitle":"Powers of fractions","urlWithinCurationNode":"/math/pre-algebra/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations/xb4832e56:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals/v/powers-of-fractions"},{"__typename":"Exercise","canonicalUrl":"/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/x0267d782:cc-6th-exponents-and-order-of-operations/x0267d782:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals/e/powers-of-fractions","contentDescriptor":"Exercise:x3d6eec93","contentKind":"Exercise","exerciseLength":4,"id":"x3d6eec93","isSkillCheck":false,"parentTopic":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"x7a0e241f7b4ceab3","parent":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"x9bc0b4ab98c81322","masteryEnabled":true}},"progressKey":"ex3d6eec93","slug":"powers-of-fractions","sponsored":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/BeOgMWy4wbB_Q_hya2R5VB6kM67lVZt4Kk7QK0qeQF8kNTAZdgQySmtM2CjlKCnM43zq5iJ325T-aH9yhE89dd4","timeEstimate":{"__typename":"TimeEstimate","lowerBound":4,"upperBound":6},"translatedCustomTitleTag":"","translatedDescription":"Practice taking positive whole-number powers of fractions and decimals.","translatedTitle":"Powers of fractions \u0026 decimals","urlWithinCurationNode":"/math/pre-algebra/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations/xb4832e56:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals/e/powers-of-fractions"},{"__typename":"Article","canonicalUrl":"/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/x0267d782:cc-6th-exponents-and-order-of-operations/cc-6th-exponents/a/exponents-review","contentDescriptor":"Article:xc6b0c217","contentKind":"Article","id":"xc6b0c217","parentTopic":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"xeee740b6","parent":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"x9bc0b4ab98c81322","masteryEnabled":true}},"progressKey":"axc6b0c217","slug":"exponents-review","translatedCustomTitleTag":"","translatedDescription":"Review the basics of exponents and try some practice problems. ","translatedTitle":"Exponents review","urlWithinCurationNode":"/math/pre-algebra/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations/xb4832e56:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals/a/exponents-review"}],"id":"x6b747e8cca382b86","key":"ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXIcCxIFVG9waWMiEXg2Yjc0N2U4Y2NhMzgyYjg2DA","relativeUrl":"/math/pre-algebra/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations/xb4832e56:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals","slug":"xb4832e56:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals","translatedDescription":"","translatedTitle":"Powers of fractions and decimals"},{"__typename":"TopicQuiz","canonicalUrl":"/math/pre-algebra/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations/xb4832e56:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals/quiz/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations-quiz-1","contentDescriptor":"TopicQuiz:x62c610b192e5c6f5","contentKind":"Quiz","exerciseLength":5,"id":"x62c610b192e5c6f5","index":0,"parentTopic":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"x6b747e8cca382b86","parent":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"x68a67857b65a80f9","masteryEnabled":true}},"progressKey":"qx62c610b192e5c6f5","slug":"xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations-quiz-1","timeEstimate":{"__typename":"TimeEstimate","lowerBound":5,"upperBound":10},"translatedCustomTitleTag":"","translatedDescription":"Review the following recommended lessons to help you learn: {list of lessons covered by quiz}","translatedTitle":"Exponents intro and order of operations: Quiz 1","urlWithinCurationNode":"/math/pre-algebra/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations/xb4832e56:powers-of-fractions-and-decimals/quiz/xb4832e56:exponents-intro-and-order-of-operations-quiz-1"},{"__typename":"Lesson","curatedChildren":[{"__typename":"Video","canonicalUrl":"/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/x0267d782:cc-6th-exponents-and-order-of-operations/cc-6th-order-of-operations/v/order-operations-intro","contentDescriptor":"Video:x2b14c51a7861494c","contentKind":"Video","id":"x2b14c51a7861494c","parentTopic":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"x1f8ecc11","parent":{"__typename":"Topic","id":"x9bc0b4ab98c81322","masteryEnabled":true}},"progressKey":"vx2b14c51a7861494c","slug":"order-operations-intro","translatedCustomTitleTag":"","translatedDescription":"The order of operations is a crucial math concept that ensures consistent results when solving problems with multiple operations.
